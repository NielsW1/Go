GO - Installation and user guide

Download the GoClient.jar and GoServer.jar files from the bin directory to
a location of your choosing.
Make sure you have the Java Runtime Environment 21 (JRE) installed.
The game can be run from the command line. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded
the .jar files and use the command:

- java -jar GoServer.jar

When you start the server, it will ask for a port to start listening for connections. Enter
any valid port number between 0 and 65535. The server will then start on the port you entered.

Then, start the client using the command:

- java -jar GoClient.jar

The client will ask for an ip address and a port to connect to. Enter the ip address and the port
separated by a space, for example:

- 127.0.0.1 8080

It will then ask if you want to connect as a human player or if you want to connect as a
computer player that plays for you. Enter "AI" to connect as a computer,
or "HUMAN" to connect as a player yourself.

The client will then connect to the server or throw an error if it was unable to do so.
Use the command HELP to show all valid commands that can be used in the client.

Enter LOGIN~<username> to log in to the server.
Use the command GUI to enable the GUI. This is only possible before a game is started.
Use QUEUE to join the waiting queue. As soon as two players join the queue, a game
will automatically start.
When a game has started, you can use the MOVE~N or MOVE~col,row commands to make a move
when it's your turn.
Use PASS to pass your current turn
Use RESIGN to forfeit the game.
